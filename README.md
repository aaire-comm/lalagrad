<b><h1>lalagrad</h1></b> lalagrad is a mid-level Deep learning framework currently under development<br> 

<b>[In Progress]</b>


for Educational purposes mainly and will be between [@tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) and [@microrad](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

<h3><b>The plan</b></h3>
Though am building this to learn, the final thing has to be as fast as <b>Numpy</b> if not faster.
And with a decent nn module<br>

<h3><b>Tensors</b></h3>

most tensor creation methods and operations supported by tinygrad will be here (may be all of them) look at [lalagrad/tensor.py](https://github.com/leulshawel/lalagrad/blob/main/lalagrad/tensor.py)
